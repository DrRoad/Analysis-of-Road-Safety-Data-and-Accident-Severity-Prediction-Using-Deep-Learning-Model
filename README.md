Analysis of Road Safety Data and Accident Severity Prediction Using Deep Learning Model



1.	INTRODUCTION:

Trafﬁc accidents are a key apprehension due to many fatalities and economic sufferers every year worldwide. In Great Britain, recent statistics showing that there are nearly 3 deaths per 100,000 people, for all road users. Motorways are potential sites of fatal highway accidents in UK. The accident data analysis, visualization and better accident severity prediction models will be helpful in enhancing the safety performance of road trafﬁc  system. 
Traffic accidents are generally classified into fatal, serious and slight accidents based on their severity. Each accident severity has some pattern relation with accident related physical features such as accident location, weather conditions, light conditions, season, month, day, time, driver experience etc... My case study is mainly on analysing the accidents data and use statistical deep learning techniques to predict accident severity.

2.	AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THE TASK:

The aim of this case study is to load/ingest data & analyse data using Big Data Tools & Technologies and finally develop a deep learning model to predict accident severity. For this task, I have used three data sets provided by University of Salford, as part of academic assignment along with meta data for them. I used various cloud based Big Data Tools and services by Google Cloud Platform(GCP) for loading, analysing and reporting data for various problem statements.  I enhanced this task further to more analysis and visualization related to accidents data. Finally, I developed a neural network/deep learning model to predict the accident severity based on various features such as conditions of weather, road, location and previous history of accidents.
For this task, I have used following list of GCP[1] Cloud Services.
1.	GOOGLE DATAPROC
2.	GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE 
3.	GOOGLE CLOUD SQL
4.	GOOGLE BIGQUERY 
5.	GOOGLE AI NOTEBOOK 

3.	 BASIC LITERATURE REVIEW:

This case study presents a review of analysing accident data in order to determine what kind of factors of transport infrastructure, vehicle type, driver behaviour, vehicle speed, environmental  conditions(weather, light) and road or area category have influence on accidents and also review of classification techniques used to predict accident severity based on various conditional factors.
The driver accident severity can be classiﬁed into a few categories such as fatal, serious and slight. Therefore, modelling accident severity can be addressed as a pattern recognition problem, which can be solved by deep learning, statistical techniques and sometimes by physical modelling approaches. 

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of deep learning module, which is more appropriate for sequential data (e.g., trafﬁc accident data with temporal correlations). But as far as this application is concerned, I used Optimized ANN technique to predict the accident severity.
